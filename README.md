# BasicStringUtilities

File includes Java code for the following basic string utilities:

1. Capitalizing the first letter of each word in a string.
2. Reversing the entire string (i.e "the hungry catepillar" returns "rallipetac yrgnuh eht").
3. Reversing each word in a string (i.e. "the hungry catepillar" returns "eht yrgnuh rallipetac").
4. Reversing the entire string, then capitalizing the first letter of each word.
5. Removing the first and last character of a string.
6. Inverting the casing of a string (i.e "HAPpy daNCE" returns "hapPY DAnce").
7. Individual methods for detemining whether a string contains entirely alpha, numeric or special characters.

Tests for each method are included.
